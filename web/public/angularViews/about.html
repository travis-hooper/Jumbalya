			Jumbalya was originally written as a Ruby text scrambling method (no password) that I wrote in a night for fun. It 
			worked by taking the original input text and assigning a numerical 2 digit code to each character (e.g. A = 96 and ! = 99), 
			then performing a number of systematic shifts, it converted the input into something visually similar to what it returns now. 
			I sat on the method for a few months until I was finished at MakerSquare before I decided to build it out into a full blown 
			web application with some added modifications that I picked up along the way.

			One of the things I discovered along the way was SHA-1, a cryptographic hash function that irreversibly but consistently 
			converts any text input into a 40 character hexadecimal number. I decided to implement this into my original design by digesting 
			a salted password with SHA-1, then use the hexadecimal output to control both the shifts performed for the encryption method and 
			the shifts on where to grab the next value from the SHA-1 hash value. Long story short, I'm confident that someone using anything 
			other than brute-force attack, couldn't decrypt the output. But I'll buy you a cookie if you can. Lastly, if for some reason I 
			decide to change the encryption method somewhere down the road, I added in some reverse compatibility by prefixing every output 
			with 'aa'. The original decryption method will recognize the prefix and work accordingly.

			With a working method in place, I decided to deploy 'Jumbalya' as a web application on Heroku with a Sinatra back-end serving it 
			as a single page application with two post routes and AngularJS and Bootstrap to tie the front-end together.
